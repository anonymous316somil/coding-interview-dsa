# DSA Practice Repository

This repository contains my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** practice for **interview preparation, internships, and placements**.

I am solving problems from platforms like:
- GeeksforGeeks
- LeetCode
- Takeuforward
- Codechef
- Codeforces

The focus is on:
- Clean and readable code
- Optimal time and space complexity
- Strong problem-solving fundamentals
